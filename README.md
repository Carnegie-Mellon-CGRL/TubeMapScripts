# TubeMapScripts
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing data from microCT images for pulmonary vessels using the ClearMap software package (https://christophkirst.github.io/ClearMap2Documentation/html/home.html). These scripts rely on installation of ClearMap using anaconda and/or graph-tool (https://graph-tool.skewed.de/). CTpulmonary.py is used for segmentation, skeletonization, and generation of a spatial graph representation of the pulmonary arteries. graphToCenterline.py uses vtk to generate a .vtp file for interaction in Paraview (can be imported as a Legacy VTK type) and visualization. reduce_graph_helper.py imports a useful function from ClearMap for use in graph-tool, that reduces serial vessel segments into one with averaged radii from the serial segments. generate_morph_input_gt.py post-processes the graph made by CTpulmonary.py for use in the code for generating morphometric trees (in separate repository PAMorphometry) and in calcHemoTree (in development) to simulate the reduced order hemodynamics.
